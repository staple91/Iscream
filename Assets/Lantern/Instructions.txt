This lantern uses a script which enables and disables parts of the Lantern Prefabs childed objects,
the light and the particle affect are affected. Pressing 'L' at runtime will toggle the lantern.

Lights may need their render mode set to important.

Two versions of the lantern have been created, one has a separated handle should you need to use it for any custom animations.
